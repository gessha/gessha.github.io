    <h1 id="appimaged-where-were-you-all-this-time">appimaged, where were you all this time?</h1>
<p><strong>TLDR: There is a daemon <a href="https://github.com/probonopd/go-appimage">appimaged</a> you can install that watches for new AppImage files in /bin and ~/Downloads and automatically installs them.</strong></p>
<p>I've been using Linux systems for a while now and honestly, I've never really cared about how applications enter my system as long as I don't have to work too hard for it. I just want to get my work done and I'm okay with any type of packaging system, be it deb packages, AppImages, or Flatpaks, whatever works, works. However, I get annoyed whenever I see ineffincies that could be solved with some small amount of effort. </p>
<p>One such annoyance is how AppImages get installed - you download it, open a terminal in the download directory, <code>chmod u+x</code> the file and then maybe move it to another directory. Why do I need to do all these things, why can't I just download them and use them right away?</p>
<p>To solve this annoyance, I was thinking of making my own daemon which checks for new AppImages in ~/Downloads and does the above things automatically. However, I never got around to, so I just suffered in silence. However, I was reading an online discussion and I read about <a href="https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html?highlight=daemon#appimaged">appimaged</a> a daemon which checks predefined set of directories on the user's system and makes them accessible to the user. This is exactly what I was looking for! I dug around and I found that it's been around <a href="https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/appimaged">since at least 2018</a>. Why is this not part of distros? I know different distributions promote their own way of package distribution but this just makes sense to include.</p>
<p>I saw a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-are-appimages-and-how-do-you-use-them-on-linux/">zdnet article</a> from this year that kind of introduces this application distribution but it doesn't even mention appimaged. Why? </p>
<p>Anyway, install appimaged and enjoy your AppImages.</p>
