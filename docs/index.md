Hello there, my name is Georgi Georgiev and I am a computer vision researcher with background and experience in instance segmentation and unconstrained lip synchronization (lipsync).

Once upon a time, I tried the academic career path but I realized it's not for me and I dropped out.

I am searching for useful and practical applications for machine learning and I like solving problems with code, both through traditional programming as well as machine learning and AI techniques.

In my spare time, I like reading comics(manga/manhwa/manhua/comics), biking, consuming longer-form content and cooking.
