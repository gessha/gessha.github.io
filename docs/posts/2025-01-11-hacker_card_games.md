Happy New Years! I hope the new year brings you and your loved ones new energy for care and maximum effort. Let's find the time to clean up our corners of the world and spread good vibes. In light of this, I decided to be more proactive about curating online content, particularly from the good parts of the Internet. In a [recent Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42658614) I found a bunch of interesting games that can be played using a regular 52-card deck. Here's a compilation of those games for public reference and some sidenotes pulled from comments. 

The HN post references the game called Cuttle whose mechanics closely resemble the more popular and more recent game [Magic the Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering). Apparently [Richard Garfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garfield), the creator of MtG,  had never heard of Cuttle [until recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/17cb47k/cuttle_is_the_oldest_battle_card_game_and_youve/). The original inspiration for MtG was [Cosmic Encounter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Encounter), a board game from 1977 where players battle against each other for control over the universe.
