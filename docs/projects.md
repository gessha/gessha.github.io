## Hacker News "Who is hiring?" frontend
Every beginning of the month I head out to HN's Who Is Hiring posts just to scroll for quite some time before finding relevant to me or clicking through a link and losing my scroll position. To solve this, I used Algolia's API for Hacker News to access all posts for a "Who is Hiring" post and parse them into a database schema using ChatGPT's API. The database is accessed through a Flask backend and Handlebars+Bootstrap frontend.
