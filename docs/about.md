# About

Hello there, my name is Georgi Georgiev and a computer vision researcher with background and experience in instance segmentation and unconstrained lip synchonization (lipsync). 

I like solving problems with code, both through traditional programming as well as machine learning and AI techniques.

Once upon a time, I tried the academic route but I realized it's not for me and I dropped out.

In my spare time, I like consuming all kinds of media, including books, articles, manga, anime, among many others.
